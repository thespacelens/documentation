# Need for ETH to cover SPACE token transactions

The SPACE tokens in an [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org) based tokens \(ERC-20\). Each time someone wants to send an Ethereum based token \(e.g. USDT, USDC, UNI or SPACE for example\), they will need to have a minimum of Ethereum on their wallet to cover the gas fees. The gas fees are always paid in Ether. This happens only when you want to send the tokens. You don't need to have ETH when you are on the one receiving the tokens.

The amount of Ethereum you need depends on the gas cost at the time on the Ethereum network. It can vary based on the congestion of the network other variables that will set what will be the miner fees.
