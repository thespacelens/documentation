## Updates

We are constantly updating and pushing new functionalities to the platform. We intend to document all the different features as we release them. Please feel free to reach out to us if you find an outdated article or if you feel there is something that should be added. 

## Sections

We will provide in each section a brief introduction of the functionality and its use in the Spacelens platform. We will then add some explanations, guides, and answers to the most frequently asked questions. 

In general, the features listed on this documentation will remain available within the Spacelens ecosystem. The design and user experience might evolve as improvements are made but the basic functionalities will stay the same or will get upgraded. 

## Functionalities

This documentation describes functionalities that exist within our desktop platform as well as the functionalities that are available on mobile. The development team always intends to match as much as possible all environments but there is often a slight delay or difference between environments. Some functionalities would also only exist in the desktop while others in mobile.
