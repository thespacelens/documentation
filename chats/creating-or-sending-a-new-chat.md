# Creating or sending a new chat

## Chats are associated with products, services, or cryptocurrencies

In order to start chatting with someone, simply click on a product or a story and you will see a chat button appear. Clicking on it will open a new window for you to chat with the other user.

ðŸ§  In order to avoid receiving messages from random people, users can create a chat only after having visited a product or listing. The chat will open and you will see who is contacting you for what items. If you don't have created a listing, other users won't be able to chat with you on the platform.
