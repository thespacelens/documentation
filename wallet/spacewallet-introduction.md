# Spacewallet introduction

Users on Spacelens can decide to create a blockchain or crypto wallet to manage and store several of their cryptocurrencies and tokens.

Our crypto wallet name is Spacewallet. You can find more information on its features on the [Spacewallet](https://www.spacewallet.org) page.

The Spacewallet is an advanced and unique wallet as it intends to merge both standard functionalities of a crypto wallet \(sending, receiving, storing tokens\) with additional functionalities that can be used for eCommerce. 

### Your private keys, your coins

The Spacewallet is a non-custodial wallet which allows users to have their own private keys. We don't manage your wallet for you, nor can we have any access to it. You can import any wallet you created elsewhere on our platform and you can decide to easily switching wallet by using your private keys on another application. This process is fully decentralized.

> â€¼ If you lose the access to your private keys, you will lose the access to your wallet forever. Please store them in a safe place, don't share them with anyone, do not store them on your computer or email, and never lose them! The best is to keep them on a piece of paper and put it inside a lock.
>
> We CANNOT help you recover your private keys or the credentials of your wallet. It is technically not possible so please be careful with your keys.
