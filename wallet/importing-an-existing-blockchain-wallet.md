# Importing an existing blockchain wallet

On Spacelens, you can easily import an existing crypto wallet to your [spacelens wallet](https://www.spacewallet.org/).

Simply visit the Spacewallet tab from the mobile app and instead of creating a new wallet, decide to import an existing one.

You will need your seed phrase or private key to be able to import your wallet. Simply add your seed phrase that you created on a previous blockchain wallet to be able to access this same account to your Spacewallet.

On the blockchain, when you import your seed from one wallet to another wallet, the original wallet will keep showing the cryptocurrencies that you have as the wallets function is to let you read, send and receive the tokens that you own on the Blockchain. You would technically be able to use both wallets with the different features that each offer whether it is on Spacelens or on another platform.
